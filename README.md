<p>A simple memory matching game. The user clicks two cards (images of memes) to try to match them. If there's a match, the cards disappear from the board. If there's no match, the cards are flipped back to their blank side so the user can try again.</p>

<p>The game consists of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
